## what should i eat?

### description -

a web app that helps you decide what to cook based on the ingredients you have on hand.

i decided to make this a bit of a challenge on myself and gave myself a time limit of a week to complete this project. since i have to work a full-time job, i have to be very efficient with my time, and i think this will be a good way to push myself to be more productive. i'm giving myself about 2-3 hours a day to work on this project, and more on my days off. i'm excited to see how this turns out.

### day 1 -

created basic structure of the app. styling, inputs, modal, and ingredients list are all functional. i got a lot of the basic important stuff done today, so i'm happy. gotta work tomorrow!!
