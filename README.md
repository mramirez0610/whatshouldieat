## what should i eat?

### description -

a web app that helps you decide what to cook based on the ingredients you have on hand.

i decided to make this a bit of a challenge on myself and gave myself a time limit of a week to complete this project. since i have to work a full-time job, i have to be very efficient with my time, and i think this will be a good way to push myself to be more productive. i'm giving myself about 2-3 hours a day to work on this project, and more on my days off. i'm excited to see how this turns out.

### day 1 -

created basic structure of the app. styling, inputs, modal, and ingredients list are all functional. i got a lot of the basic important stuff done today, so i'm happy. gotta work tomorrow!!

### day 2 -

whoops.......

work and life can really get in the way, believe it or not. i decided a week time limit would definitely result in a half-baked product since i've got obligations, so a 7 day work limit will have to do. day 2 consisted of getting the restful api working correctly. from this point on, things should be simple (? maybe...), i just have to buy some credit on openai's platform, then the real meat and potatoes of this project starts. i'm excited. this will be fun to style
